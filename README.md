# Scalable Hemicycle Charts (SHecC)

This project aims to produce scalable hemicycle charts. Below is a short list
of the features it intends to implement:

* Find an optimal distribution of the seats based on the following input
  parameters:
  * The number of mandates
  * The ratio between the inner and the outer radius of the hemicycle
  * The angle of the hemicycle
* Distribute the parties across the hemicycle, and mark each seat using:
  * The party color, or for electoral alliances, a set of colors
  * A circle or a polygon, a person shape or a seat shape
  * A character
* Optionally, add a legend displaying:
  * The shape, the colors and the character per party
  * Party name
  * Number of mandates
